# Winamp Skin Archive
A collection of Winamp skins, I plan to update this as I find new ones.
I will also work on getting some images and a better file system to showcase each skin as I go.

# How to install
Just download the repo or the .wsz file you want and double click it. Winamp will automatically install the skin.

# Where to get Winamp
